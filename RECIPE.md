Set the oven to 190C, gas 5.

1. Tip the butter into a bowl and beat it until softened. Then add the sugar, flour, salt, eggs and milk and whisk until the mixture is smooth.

2. Use a traditional-style ice-cream scoop, or spoon, to divide the mixture between all the paper cases.

3. Place both muffin tins in the oven and bake for 15 minutes, then swap over the position of the tins over and bake for a further 3-7 minutes, until both trays of cupcakes are a light golden colour.

4. Remove the tins from the oven. Leave the cupcakes to cool in the tins for a few minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool.

5. They are  ready to serve now.
